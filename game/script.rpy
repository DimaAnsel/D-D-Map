    "The dense and bustling city claims face just on the Southern brim of a thick and musty swamp, which is one of the only ways the Northern part of the realm can connect to the North Western territory."

    "The only local product Colchus has to offer foreigners is transportation through the treacherous waters, and exotic foods and voodoo items."

    "However, what Colchus lacks in natural resources it makes up for in international trade."

    "Trappers, wizards, and collectors travel from the entire Northern region to gather, sell, and barter in Colchus."

    "The lore of the land tells a tale about the demon-god Vaxxak and Terâ€™Ral being engaged in a decade long conflict."

    "This conflict raged so long and so brutal that it began to tear civilization apart as they began to side with one of the two gods."

    "Xemex foresaw civilization's end from the void of space above, and joined in power with the other deities to send a star crashing down onto the two beings as they locked in a physical bout."

    "The result sent the two dissipating into the air as star dust. The deities reanimated themselves over several centuries, and the star left behind the enormous pit known as The Maw."
